Analysis of the following Roulette strategies:
- Betting on Red
- Betting on a Number
- James Bond Strategy
- D'Alembert Strategy
- Martingale

This was a project completed as part of my MSc in Statistics at the London School of Economics and was completed in partnership with fellow classmates who are credited in [Roulette_Strategy_Report](Roulette_Strategy_Report.pdf). The bulk of my work was on the James Bond Strategy, as well as codebase contributions, and data visualizations.

Code implementation is done in R.
